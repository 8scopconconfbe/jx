The game also features some of the most memorable locations and characters from the Bond franchise, such as Paris, Tokyo, Austria, and outer space. You will encounter familiar faces like M, Q, and Moneypenny, as well as new allies and enemies. The voice acting is superb, with Pierce Brosnan reprising his role as Bond and other actors lending their talents to the game.

But the game is not without its flaws. The PC version of James Bond 007: Nightfire is different from the console versions, which were developed by a different studio. The PC version has fewer missions, less variety, and more bugs. The graphics are also dated by today's standards, and the controls can be clunky at times. The multiplayer mode is also disappointing, with limited options and modes. The game also suffers from poor AI, which can make the enemies too easy or too hard to deal with.
 
Despite these drawbacks, James Bond 007: Nightfire is still a fun and enjoyable game that will make you feel like a secret agent. The game has a lot of replay value, thanks to its multiple difficulty levels, unlockable content, and cheat codes.
