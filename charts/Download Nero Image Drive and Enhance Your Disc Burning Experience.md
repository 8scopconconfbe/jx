In this section, we will show you how to create a simple website using Adobe Muse CC 2014. You will learn how to set up your site, add pages, design your layout, and publish your website online.
 
## Step 1: Set up your site
 
To start a new project in Adobe Muse CC 2014, open the program and click on the Create New Site button. You will see a dialog box where you can enter the basic information about your site, such as the name, the dimensions, the resolution, and the language. You can also choose a preset layout for desktop, tablet, or phone devices. For this example, we will use the Desktop preset with a width of 960 pixels and a height of 500 pixels. Click OK to create your site.
 
You will see a blank canvas where you can design your website. On the left side of the screen, you will see the Plan view, which shows the structure of your site and the pages you have. On the right side of the screen, you will see the Design view, which shows the appearance of your pages and the elements you have. You can switch between these views by clicking on the tabs at the top of the screen.
 
## Step 2: Add pages
 
To add a new page to your site, go to the Plan view and click on the + button next to the Home page. You will see a dialog box where you can enter the name of your page and choose a master page.

Click OK to add your page.

You can repeat this process to add more pages to your site. For this example, we will add three more pages: About, Services, and Contact. You can rearrange the order of your pages by dragging and dropping them in the Plan view. You can also create subpages by dragging and dropping them under another page. For this example, we will create a subpage under Services called Web Design.
 
## Step 3: Design your layout
 
To design your layout, go to the Design view and select the page you want to work on. You will see a grid that helps you align your elements on your page. You can also use guides and rulers to measure and position your elements precisely.
 
To add an element to your page, you can use one of the tools in the toolbar at the top of the screen. For example, you can use the Text tool to add text boxes, the Rectangle tool to add shapes, or the Widget tool to add interactive elements such as slideshows or forms. You can also import images or other files from your computer by dragging and dropping them onto your page.
 
To edit an element on your page, you can use one of the panels on the right side of the screen. For example, you can use the Text panel to change the font, size, color, or alignment of your text, or use the Fill panel to change the fill color or opacity of your shapes. You can also use the Control panel at the top of the screen to access more options for each element.
 
To style your elements consistently across your site, you can use one of the styles in the Styles panel on the right side of the screen. For example, you can use a paragraph style to apply a set of formatting attributes to a text box, or use a graphic style to apply a set of appearance attributes to a shape. You can also create your own styles by clicking on the + button at the bottom of each panel.
