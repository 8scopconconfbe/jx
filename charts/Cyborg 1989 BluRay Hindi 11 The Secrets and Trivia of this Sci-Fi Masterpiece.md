Cyborg is a 1989 American science fiction action film directed by Albert Pyun and starring Jean-Claude Van Damme as a mercenary who protects a woman from a cult leader in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. The film was originally intended to be a sequel to Masters of the Universe, but the project was cancelled and the sets were reused for Cyborg. The film was also influenced by The Road Warrior and Escape from New York.
 
The film follows Gibson Rickenbacker (Van Damme), a "slinger" who escorts people through the dangerous ruins of America after a plague has wiped out most of the population. He meets Nady Simmons (Deborah Richter), a cyborg who carries vital information that could lead to a cure for the plague. However, they are pursued by Fender Tremolo (Vincent Klyn), a ruthless pirate leader who wants to use the information for his own benefit. Gibson must fight his way through Fender's army of thugs and cyborgs to save Nady and humanity.
