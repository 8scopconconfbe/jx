Columbus is not just a movie about architecture, but also a movie about feelings and relationships. The characters are complex and nuanced, and their interactions are filled with subtle emotions and unspoken tensions. The movie explores themes such as loneliness, grief, guilt, ambition, passion and love in a realistic and sensitive way. The performances by John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson are superb, conveying a lot of depth and chemistry with minimal dialogue and gestures.
 
The movie also pays homage to the cinematic influences of Kogonada, such as Yasujiro Ozu, Robert Bresson and Michelangelo Antonioni. The camera is often static, observing the characters from a distance or framing them in symmetrical compositions. The editing is slow and deliberate, creating a contemplative mood and rhythm. The soundtrack is minimal and atmospheric, using ambient sounds and music sparingly. The movie invites the audience to slow down and pay attention to the details and the silences.
 
Columbus is a rare gem of a movie that celebrates both the beauty of art and the beauty of human connection. It is a movie that challenges the viewers to look beyond the surface and appreciate the deeper meaning and value of things. It is a movie that lingers in the mind and in the heart long after it ends.

Columbus is also a movie that showcases the talent and vision of Kogonada, who made his feature directorial debut with this film. Kogonada is a Korean-born film critic and video essayist who has created insightful analyses of the works of directors such as Yasujiro Ozu, Stanley Kubrick, Robert Bresson and Michelangelo Antonioni. His passion for cinema and architecture is evident in every frame of Columbus, which he wrote, directed and edited himself.
 
The movie was shot in 18 days in Columbus, Indiana, a small city that has a rich collection of modernist buildings designed by some of the most influential architects of the 20th century. Kogonada and his cinematographer Elisha Christian used natural light and long takes to capture the beauty and harmony of these structures, as well as the emotions and conflicts of the characters. The movie also features a minimal and atmospheric soundtrack by Hammock, a post-rock band that Kogonada admired for their relationship between absence and presence in their music.
 
Columbus received critical acclaim and several awards and nominations at various film festivals, including Sundance, Rotterdam, San Francisco and Independent Spirit Awards. The movie was praised for its visual style, its performances, its themes and its originality. The movie also marked a breakthrough for John Cho and Haley Lu Richardson, who delivered nuanced and captivating performances that earned them rave reviews and recognition. Columbus is a movie that deserves to be seen and appreciated by anyone who loves cinema, architecture and human connection.
