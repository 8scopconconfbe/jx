Windows XP Professional SP3 is an old but still popular operating system that many people still use on their computers. However, if you want to install it on a newer machine that has a SATA hard drive, you may encounter some problems. This is because Windows XP does not have native support for SATA drivers, which are needed to recognize and access the hard drive during installation.
 
Fortunately, there is a solution to this problem. You can use a modified Windows XP installation CD that includes the SATA drivers. This way, you can avoid the hassle of integrating the drivers manually or using a floppy disk. In this article, we will show you how to download and use such a CD to install Windows XP Professional SP3 with SATA drivers.
