If you are a client, design professional, builder, local government official, enforcer or user of buildings, you may be interested in the latest version of BS 8300:2018 Design of an accessible and inclusive built environment. This standard provides recommendations and guidance on how to create an environment that works for as wide a range of people as possible, including disabled people, the elderly, and children.
 
BS 8300 was first published in 2001 and revised in 2009. In 2018, it was split into two parts: Part 1: External environment â code of practice and Part 2: Buildings â code of practice. Part 1 covers the design of the external features adjacent to a building, such as parking spaces, access routes, and entrances. Part 2 covers the design of the interior of buildings, such as reception areas, corridors, lifts, and toilets.
