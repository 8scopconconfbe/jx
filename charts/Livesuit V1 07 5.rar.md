LiveSuit is a small Windows computer application that allows you to flash stock firmware (.img) on Allwinner Chipset-based devices (including Allwinner A10, A13, A20, and A31 chipsets). Here on this page, we have shared the latest version of LiveSuit and the previous versions.
 
LiveSuit comes with the step-by-step upgrade Wizard, which helps you quickly load and flash the Firmware.

If you select Yes, it will start guiding the steps to load the Firmware.
