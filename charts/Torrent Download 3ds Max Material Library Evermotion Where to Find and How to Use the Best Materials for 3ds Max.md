5. Open 3ds Max and create or load your scene. Go to the Material Editor and select the renderer that matches the materials and textures that you downloaded.
6. Click on the Material/Map Browser icon and choose Open Material Library. Navigate to the folder where you extracted the Evermotion materials and textures and select the .mat file that corresponds to your renderer.

That's it! You can now enjoy using Evermotion materials and textures for 3ds Max in your projects. You can also check out their other products, such as 3d models, scenes, HDRI maps and more.
  
Evermotion materials and textures are designed to work with different renderers and software, but they may not look exactly the same in every case. This is because each renderer has its own settings, features and limitations that affect the appearance of the materials and textures. For example, some renderers may support features like displacement, subsurface scattering, glossiness, etc., while others may not.
 
Therefore, it is important to understand how your renderer works and how to adjust the materials and textures accordingly. You can find some tutorials and guides on the Evermotion website and on their YouTube channel that explain how to use their products with different renderers and software.
