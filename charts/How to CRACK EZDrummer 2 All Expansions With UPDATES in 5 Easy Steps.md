## How to Choose the Best Expansion for Your Project
 
EZdrummer 2 comes with two default drum kits: Modern and Vintage. These are great for general purposes, but if you want to get more specific sounds and styles, you need to use one of the many expansion packs available. Each expansion pack contains one or more drum kits, as well as MIDI grooves, presets, mixer settings, and more.
 
To choose the best expansion for your project, you need to consider several factors, such as:

- The genre and mood of your music. For example, if you are making a rock song, you might want to use an expansion like Rock!, Rock Solid, or Seventies Rock. If you are making a jazz song, you might want to use an expansion like Jazz or Latin Percussion.
- The sound and feel of the drums. For example, if you want a warm and organic sound, you might want to use an expansion like Americana, Indie Folk, or Southern Soul. If you want a crisp and punchy sound, you might want to use an expansion like Metal Machine, Electronic, or Hip-Hop!
- The level of customization and control. For example, if you want a simple and easy way to get a good drum sound, you might want to use an expansion like Number 1 Hits, Pop!, or Dream Pop. If you want a more advanced and flexible way to shape your drum sound, you might want to use an expansion like Progressive, Metalheads, or Twisted Kit. 8cf37b1e13
