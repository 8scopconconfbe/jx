## Edirol Orchestral VST Review
 
Edirol Orchestral VST is not a new plugin, but it still has many fans and users who appreciate its sound quality and features. It is based on the Roland Orchestral Sound Canvas library, which was used extensively in TV and film scoring in the 90s. The plugin has updated the samples and added more options and controls to make it more versatile and expressive[^3^].
 
Edirol Orchestral VST has a simple and intuitive interface, with four main sections: Orchestra, Part, Effect and Mixer. The Orchestra section lets you choose from 16 different instrument categories, such as Strings, Brass, Woodwinds, Percussion and Keyboards. Each category has several presets that cover different styles and articulations. You can also create your own presets by combining up to four instruments from different categories.
 
The Part section lets you adjust the parameters of each instrument, such as volume, pan, transpose, tune, attack, release and expression. You can also assign MIDI controllers to any of these parameters for more dynamic control. The Effect section lets you apply reverb and chorus effects to each instrument or to the whole orchestra. You can choose from several types and adjust the level and depth of each effect. The Mixer section lets you adjust the volume and pan of each instrument or mute and solo them.
 
Edirol Orchestral VST has a rich and realistic sound that can suit many genres and styles of music. It is especially good for creating classical, cinematic and ambient music. The plugin has a wide range of sounds that can cover most orchestral needs, from solo instruments to full sections. The sounds are well balanced and blend well together. The plugin also has some nice features that enhance the realism and expression of the sounds, such as vibrato, tremolo, pizzicato and spiccato.
