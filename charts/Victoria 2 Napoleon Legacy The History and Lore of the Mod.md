# Victoria 2 Napoleon Legacy: A Mod Review
 
Victoria 2 is a grand strategy game that simulates the political, economic, and social aspects of the 19th and early 20th centuries. It allows players to choose from over 200 countries and guide them through historical events, such as the Industrial Revolution, the Scramble for Africa, and the World Wars.
 
However, some players may find the historical setting too restrictive or boring, and may want to explore alternative scenarios and outcomes. That's where mods come in. Mods are fan-made modifications that change or add new features, content, and gameplay to the base game. There are hundreds of mods available for Victoria 2, ranging from minor tweaks to complete overhauls.

One of the most popular and ambitious mods is Napoleon's Legacy, which imagines a world where Napoleon Bonaparte won the Napoleonic Wars and established a lasting French Empire. The mod starts in 1836, after Napoleon's death, and explores the consequences of his legacy on Europe and the rest of the world.
 
Napoleon's Legacy is not just a cosmetic change of flags and names. It adds new events, decisions, countries, cultures, ideologies, rebels, wars, and more. It also changes the balance of power and the dynamics of alliances and rivalries. For example, France is the dominant power in Europe, but faces challenges from Britain, Prussia, Russia, and Austria. The Ottoman Empire is crumbling under nationalist movements and foreign intervention. The United States is divided into several states with different political orientations. China is a rising force that threatens European colonialism in Asia. And so on.
 
The mod also has a lot of flavor and historical plausibility. It incorporates elements from real history, such as the Congress of Vienna, the Greek War of Independence, and the Franco-Prussian War, but with different outcomes and twists. It also creates fictional scenarios that are based on historical possibilities or speculations, such as the French invasion of India, the German unification under Prussia or Austria, or the formation of a Latin American Federation.
 
Napoleon's Legacy is not a finished product, however. It is still in development and has some bugs and issues that need to be fixed. Some features are incomplete or missing, such as technology trees, industry mechanics, and naval warfare. Some countries lack events or decisions that would make them more interesting or challenging to play. Some aspects of the mod may be unbalanced or unrealistic, such as population growth, economy performance, or military strength.
 
Despite these flaws, Napoleon's Legacy is a mod that deserves attention and praise for its creativity and scope. It offers a fresh and exciting experience for Victoria 2 players who want to explore a different history and shape their own destiny. It is a mod that challenges players to think strategically and diplomatically, as well as to learn more about history and culture.
