Matlab is a popular software for numerical computing, data analysis, and visualization. Matlab requires a license file to run on your computer or on a network server. The license file contains information about your license type, expiration date, and authorized products. Depending on your license type and operating system, the location of your license file may vary.

In this article, we will show you how to find your license file for Matlab 2014a on different platforms.
 
## Windows
 
If you have an individual license, your license file is stored in the following folder:
 `%AppData%\MathWorks\MATLAB\R2014a_licenses` 
The %AppData% folder is hidden by default. To get there, open the Start Menu, enter %AppData% in the search box, and press enter. It can also be located at:
 `C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming` 
If you have a designated computer, concurrent, or network named user license, your license file is stored in the "licenses" folder within the Matlab installation folder. If Matlab is installed in the default location, your license file is stored here:
 `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2014a\licenses` 
## MacOS
 
If you have an individual license, your license file is stored in the Application Support directory. Click on the Finder icon in your dock (the blue face) and go to the "Go" menu in the menu bar. Select "Go to Folder " and enter this:
 `/Users/$USER/Library/Application Support/MathWorks/MATLAB/` 
where $USER is the username you use to login to your computer. In the folder that opens up, your license files are stored in the "R2014a\_licenses" folder.
 
If you have a designated computer, concurrent, or network named user license, your license file is stored inside the Matlab application package. Right click, CTRL-click, or two-finger click on the Matlab icon in your Applications folder and select "Show Package Contents." In the folder that opens up, open the "licenses" folder to see your license files[^1^].
