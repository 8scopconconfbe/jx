The Chronicles of Narnia movies feature a talented cast of actors who bring the characters to life. The four siblings are played by William Moseley (Peter), Anna Popplewell (Susan), Skandar Keynes (Edmund) and Georgie Henley (Lucy), who were relatively unknown at the time of casting. They deliver convincing performances as the children who grow up in Narnia and face various challenges and dangers. The voice of Aslan, the majestic lion and the true king of Narnia, is provided by Liam Neeson, who adds a sense of authority and wisdom to the role. Tilda Swinton plays the villainous White Witch, Jadis, who rules Narnia with an iron fist and a curse of eternal winter. Swinton portrays the witch with a cold and cruel demeanor, but also with a hint of vulnerability and desperation. Other notable actors who appear in the movies include James McAvoy as Mr. Tumnus, the friendly faun who befriends Lucy; Jim Broadbent as Professor Kirke, the eccentric owner of the house where the wardrobe is located; James Cosmo as Father Christmas, who gives gifts to the children; and Ben Barnes as Prince Caspian, the rightful heir to the throne of Narnia.
